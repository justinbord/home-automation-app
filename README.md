CS499 Home Automation App.

Project Description:
The advancement of smart homes in recent years has evolved very quickly. The variety of sensors, 
monitors, automation, and human interface options are almost endless. The Home IoT project simulates sensor data and user interaction with a smart home. 

The project handles both current state information (I.e. what are the sensors indicating right now) and historical information (I.e. what did the sensors report for the last X days).

Project will not run as database info and other private keys are redacted!
